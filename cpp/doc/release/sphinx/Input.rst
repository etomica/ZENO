   \maketitle

The primary input file, also known as a ``.bod`` file and required by all types of calculation, contains the description
of the object and some additional input parameters. Additionally, an optional ``.ff`` file may be specified for virial calculations, 
containing information about the inter- and intra-particle force fields; if not specified, objects are considered to be rigid assemblies 
of particles interacting as hard spheres.

.. _defineobj:

Defining the object(s)
----------------------

A single object of interest must be described by a collection of spheres
and cuboids, which may or may not be overlapping. The code has also be extended for the case of running not just a single snapshot composed of a collection of 
spheres, but also a trajectory or series of snapshots each composed of a collection of spheres.  Alternatively, multiple different objects (mixtures)
may be of interest for virial calculations, and these are handled in the ``.bod`` file using the SPECIES keyword, :ref:`as described below<Mixtures>`.
In all cases, object shapes are defined in a ``.bod`` file.

Spheres
~~~~~~~

Spheres are defined by lines of the form

.. code-block:: none

	SPHERE x y z r

where ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` are the coordinates of the center of the 
sphere and ``r`` is the radius.

For example, a ``.bod`` file that contains the
following describes an object composed of two spheres: one of radius 2
at :math:`x=0`, :math:`y=0`, and :math:`z=1` and one of radius 3 at
:math:`x=0`, :math:`y=0`, and :math:`z=-1`.
	
.. code-block:: none

	SPHERE 0 0 1 2
	SPHERE 0 0 -1 3   

Virial-coefficient calculations can use only SPHERE, not CUBOID, etc. In conjunction with this,
if a ``.ff`` force-field file is specified, and it includes
a ``nonbond_coeff`` statement, then the parameter ``r`` in the SPHERE statement
is interpreted not as a hard-sphere radius, but instead as an atom-type index.
This index is used to assign non-bonded potential interactions :ref:`as described below<Nonbond>`.

Cuboids
~~~~~~~

Cuboids can be defined in several ways.  The most basic is a line of the
form

.. code-block:: none

	CUBOID x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2

where ``x1``, ``y1``, and ``z1`` are the coordinates of one corner of the
cuboid and ``x2``, ``y2``, and ``z2`` are the coordinates of the opposite
corner.  The edges of the cuboid are aligned with the :math:`x, y, z` axes.

A cuboid with all edges the same length is a cube.  Cubes can be defined
with lines of the form

.. code-block:: none

	CUBE x y z L

where ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` are the coordinates of one corner of the cube
and ``L`` is the edge length.  This is equivalent to

.. code-block:: none

	CUBOID x y z x+L y+L z+L

For example, a ``.bod`` file that contains the following describes an
object composed of two cuboids: one with a corner at :math:`x=0, y=0, z=0`
and opposite corner at :math:`x=1, y=2, z=3` and one with a corner at
:math:`x=1, y=0, z=0` and opposite corner at :math:`x=5, y=4, z=4`.

.. code-block:: none

	CUBOID 0 0 0 1 2 3
	CUBE 1 0 0 4

Finally, sets of cuboids can be defined in a binary file in the ``.fits.gz``
format [1]_ using the voxels command.  Voxels are specified with lines of the
form

.. code-block:: none

	VOXELS <relative path to .fits.gz file>

Paths to the ``.fits.gz`` file are relative to the location of the ``.bod``
file.  So, for example, if you had a voxels file ``voxels.fits.gz`` in the
same directory as the ``.bod`` file, you could simply specify it as

.. code-block:: none

	VOXELS voxels.fits.gz

.. [1] https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/

Multiple snapshots or trajectories of spheres
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to be compatible with a variety of existing software packages, the trajectories of spheres are defined using the xyz file format and referenced in the ``.bod`` file. The format of the xyz file is

.. code-block:: none

	<number of atoms>
	comment line
	<atom type> <x> <y> <z>
	...

where ``atom type`` can be either a number or string, such as an element symbol. This structure can be repeated multiple times for multiple snapshots. For example,

.. code-block:: none

	2
	snapshot 1
	A -1 0 0
	B 0.25 0 0
	1
	snapshot 2
	A 0 0 0

would define two spheres of different types for the first snapshot and one sphere for the second snapshot where that sphere is the same type as the first sphere in the first snapshot. As the xyz file format does not contain radii information, a second conversion file that defines the radius of each atom type is needed. The conversion file format is

.. code-block:: none

	<atom type> <radius>

Each atom type in the xyz file must be defined. A corresponding conversion file for the xyz file example could be

.. code-block:: none

	A 1
	B 0.25

In this case, together the two examples define a system of two touching spheres one of radius 1 and one of radius 1/4 for the first snapshot and a single sphere of radius 1 for the second snapshot.
 
The xyz file and the conversion file are specified in the ``.bod`` file as

.. code-block:: none

	TRAJECTORY <relative path to xyz file> <relative path to conversion file>
	
Note that if a trajectory is given, no other geometry may be included in the ``.bod`` file.

Trajectory files cannot be used for virial-coefficient calculations.

.. _Mixtures:

Mixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virial coefficients can be computed for sets of unlike particles, for the purpose of describing their mixtures.
For a :math:`c`-component mixture, the :math:`n^{\rm th}` virial coefficient of the mixture is given as a mole-fraction
weighted sum of virial coefficients computed for all the unique combinations of the species that can be formed by
taking them :math:`n` at a time.  For example, the second virial coefficient of species labeled 1 and 2 involves three
coefficients, :math:`B_{11}`, :math:`B_{12}`, and :math:`B_{22}`, where :math:`B_{ij}` is the coefficient for a particle
of species :math:`i` and a particle of species :math:`j`.  Then,

:math:`B_{\rm mix} = B_{11}x_1^2 + 2 B_{12}x_1x_2 + B_{22}x_2^2`

where :math:`x_i` is the mole fraction of species :math:`i`.
For the general case, there are :math:`{n+c-1 \choose c-1}` such coefficients.

A single ZENO run provides a single mixture-coefficient value. The coefficient to be calculated is specified using
multiple instances of the SPECIES keyword

.. code-block:: none

	SPECIES <filename.bod>

The specified file is a conventional ``.bod`` file providing the definition of a particle of that species.  If a mixture calculation
is being performed, the number of SPECIES lines must equal the order of the coefficient specified in the 
command line. The ``.bod`` file containing SPECIES statements is the one referenced at the command line, and should contain no other statements.  A specific `.bod`
file may appear more than once in the SPECIES list. For example, to compute the 3rd-virial mixture coefficient :math:`B_{112}`,
the ``.bod`` file referenced from the command line should contain only the three lines (in any order)

.. code-block:: none

	SPECIES <species1.bod>
	SPECIES <species1.bod>
	SPECIES <species2.bod>

(the file names do not have to be "species1", etc.).  The ``.bod`` files specified by the SPECIES statements are set up the same way as the 
conventional ``.bod`` file used for a pure-species calculation. If computing a pure-species (not mixture) virial coefficient, it is
not necessary to have a species-defining ``.bod`` fileâ€”the ``.bod`` defining the particle may be referenced directly from the
command line.

Force-field file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virial-coefficient calculations may use a force-field file. The name of this file is specified in the ``.bod`` as follows

.. code-block:: none

	FORCEFIELD <filename.ff>

The .ff suffix is not required, but is a suggested convention. The format of the content of this file :ref:`is described below<Forcefield>`.

+-------------------+-----------------------------------+

.. _Forcefield:

Force fields and Monte Carlo trials
------------------------------------

Virial-coefficient calculations perform sampling of object *configurations* (arrangement and orientation of objects with respect to each other) and 
*conformations* (arrangement of the particles or atoms making up a single object). The choice of these arrangements is governed by the inter- and 
intra-molecular force fields, or energy functions. Further, the inter-particle energies enter into the calculation of the quantities that are 
averaged in the Mayer-sampling method used to compute the virial coefficients. A ``.ff`` may be specified as described above to define these 
interactions.  The content of this file is described here. If a ``.ff`` file is not specified, all interactions are taken to be additive hard-sphere 
with the specified diameters, and all objects are considered to be rigid assemblies.

The types of Monte Carlo trials that ZENO can perform for virial-coefficient calculations are (1) stretch perturbation; (2) angle perturbation; 
(3) torsion perturbation; (4) object rotation; and (5) object translation. 
A **stretch perturbation** changes the distance between two bonded atoms in the direction of their bond, 
moving all other atoms on each side of the bond rigidly to maintain their locations relative to each other. 
An **angle perturbation** changes the angle between three bonded atoms, rigidly moving other atoms in the particle accordingly. 
Any four atoms having pair bonds in such a way to define a torsion angle may be subject to a **torsion perturbation**. In this, all the atoms in the 
particle are rotated rigidly about the torsion angle.  Whether a particular conformation-changing trial is used for sampling will depend on
the specification of the intra-particle force fields, as described below. All conformation trials are conducted in a way that keeps the 
particle's geometric center unchanged.
**Object translation and rotation** move an atom assembly as a rigid object; these trials are the primary way 
that ZENO samples configurations of the particles, and they are always performed as part of the Monte Carlo sampling.   

If the interactions are not hard-sphere, then a temperature :math:`T` is needed to compute the configuration weights and the averages needed for the virial
coefficients. This temperature is input on the command line. The energies described below are divided directly by this input temperature, so the
Boltzmann constant :math:`k_{\rm B}` is assumed to be implicit in their definitions (i.e., :math:`T` is treated as :math:`k_{\rm B}T,` or equivalently,
an energy parameter :math:`\epsilon` is treated as :math:`\epsilon/k_{\rm B}`), and the units of the force-field energy parameters should be consistent
with :math:`T`.


Intra-particle: General
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Force fields acting between and among atoms within a single object control its flexibility and the conformations that it can adopt.  
The types of interactions include 2-body (bond stretching), and 3-body (bond bending); 4-body (torsion) potentials are not supported.

Bond structures that form rings or other closed loops are not supported.

Stretch, angle, and torsion perturbation trials are each performed, or not, consistent with the intra-particle potential specifications, as described below.

Intra-particle: Bond stretch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two-body potentials are specified first by defining the style:

.. code-block:: none

	bond_style style

where ``style`` may be ``fixed``, ``harmonic``, or ``FENE``.

The bond style is global, applying to all bonded pairs, so only one specification is expected in the ``.ff`` file (if more than one is given, the last one is used).

For ``fixed`` bond style, atom pairs are held rigidly at the separation implied by their positions in the ``.bod`` file.
This is accomplished by excluding bond stretch from the Monte Carlo trials used for sampling.  
``harmonic`` and ``FENE`` bond styles are further defined by ``bond_coeff`` statements. The harmonic bond style for the 
energy :math:`u` as a function of atom separation :math:`r` is

:math:`u(r) = k (r-r_0)^2`

the force-field coefficients :math:`r_0` and :math:`k` are specified with a ``bond_coeff`` statement:

.. code-block:: none

	bond_coeff index r0 k

Multiple ``bond_coeff`` lines may be included in the ``.ff`` file.  ``index`` is an integer that is used to distinguish them when defining the 
interaction between bonded pairs, as described below. The FENE bond style (Finite Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) has the form

:math:`u(r) = -0.5 K R_0^2 \ln \left[1-\left(\frac{r}{R_0}\right)^2\right]+4 \epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]+\epsilon`

The first term extends to :math:`R_0`, the maximum extent of the bond. The second term is cutoff at :math:`2^{1/6}\sigma`, the minimum of the Lennard-Jones potential.
Coefficients are defined using

.. code-block:: none

	bond_coeff index K R0 epsilon sigma

If the same index value appears in two ``bond_coeff`` statements, the last one applies.

Specification of the bonded atom pairs is performed with the ``bonds`` keyword on its own line, followed by a sequence of lines of the form

.. code-block:: none

	index i j

where ``index`` is a value appearing in a previous ``bond_coeff`` statement, and ``i`` and ``j`` are atom indexes as given in the ``.bod`` file.
The ``bonds`` list both defines the bond force field, and identifies the bonded pairs that are subject to bond perturbation Monte Carlo trials.
If the bond style is ``fixed``, a list of bonded pairs is not required or used.

Intra-particle: Angle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three-body potentials are specified as follows:

.. code-block:: none

	angle_style style


where ``style`` may be ``fixed``, ``harmonic``, or ``none``. The angle style is global, so only one specification is expected in the ``.ff`` file (if more than one is given, the last one is used).

If no angle style is specified, the default of ``fixed`` is used.

For ``fixed`` bond style, atom pairs are held rigidly at the separation implied by their positions in the ``.bod`` file.  ``harmonic`` bond 
style is further defined by ``angle_coeff`` statements. The harmonic bond style for the energy :math:`u` as a function of angle :math:`\theta` is

:math:`u(\theta) = k (\theta-\theta_0)^2`

the force-field coefficients :math:`k` and :math:`\theta_0` are specified with an ``angle_coeff`` statement:

	angle_coeff index theta0 k

Multiple ``angle_coeff`` lines may be included in the ``.ff`` file.  ``index`` is an integer that is used to distinguish them when 
defining the interaction between bonded triplets, as described below. 

Specification of the triplets that are subject to an angle potential is performed with the ``angles`` keyword on its own line, followed by a sequence of lines of the form

.. code-block:: none

	index i j k

where ``index`` is a value appearing in a previous ``angle_coeff`` statement, and ``i``, ``j``, and ``k`` are atom indexes as given in the ``.bod`` file.
Adjacent bonded pairs that form an angle, but do not appear in the ``angles`` list, will still be sampled using angle-perturbation trials; the absence of a particular 
triplet means only that there is no energy contribution associated with that angle. In other words, the ``angles`` list affects only the definition of the force field,
and (unlike the ``bonds`` list) does not impact the application of Monte Carlo trials.

If the angle style is ``fixed``, a list of angle triplets is not required or used.


Intra-particle: Torsion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Four-body potentials are not implemented. However, torsion moves are employed to enhance sampling of conformations. There is no torsion potential 
contributing to the energy change of a torsion perturbation, but intra- and inter-particle nonbonded interaction energies
will in general be changed by such a trial move, and these enter into the decision of acceptance of the change.

Torsion trials are not performed when ``angle_style`` is selected as ``fixed``.

Intra-particle: Nonbonded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the bonded interactions, atoms in the same particle interact according to the same nonbonded potential that governs interactions
of atoms in different particles.  Specification of these interactions is provided in the next section.  Intra-particle nonbonded interactions
are applied to any pair of atoms that are not explicitly listed in the ``bonds`` list, and that are not listed together in any of the
triplets in the ``angles`` list.

.. _Nonbond:

Inter-particle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atoms in different particles interact according to the potential specifed by the nonbond style

.. code-block:: none

	nonbond_style style

where ``style`` may be ``LJ``, ``WCA``, or ``HS``. The nonbond style is global, so only one specification is expected in the ``.ff`` file 
(if more than one is given, the last one is used). If no nonbond style is specified (or if no ``.ff`` file is given), the default of ``HS`` is used.

The ``LJ`` nonbond style specifies the Lennard-Jones potential, defined as

:math:`u_{\rm LJ}(r) = 4 \epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]`

No truncation of the potential is applied. The ``WCA`` style is the soft repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential, which is the Lennard-Jones potential
shifted up to zero and truncated at its minimum-energy separation

:math:`u_{\rm WCA}(r)= \begin{cases}u_{\rm LJ}(r)+\epsilon & r<2^{â…™} \sigma \\ 0 & r\ge2^{â…™} \sigma\end{cases}`

Parameters for the ``LJ`` and ``WCA`` nonbond styles are specified with the ``nonbond_coeff`` command

.. code-block:: none

	nonbond_coeff index sigma epsilon

Multiple ``nonbond_coeff`` statements may appear in a ``.ff`` file.  The ``index`` value is used to assign the coefficients to the atoms via
the ``r`` parameter in the SPHERE statement.  For example, all atoms specified via SPHERE statements with ``r`` equal to 1 will be assigned
the non-bonded potential with coefficients given by the ``nonbond_coeff`` statement having index of 1; all SPHERE with ``r`` equal to 2 will have 
parameters assigned by ``nonbond_coeff`` with index 2, etc. 

In many cases, there will be only one ``nonbond_coeff`` statement and hence only one atom type index. When multiple ``nonbond_coeff`` are specified,
unlike atoms will interact with parameters given by Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules: 
:math:`\sigma=(\sigma_1+\sigma_2)/2`; :math:`\epsilon=(\epsilon_1 \epsilon_2)^{1/2}`.

The ``HS`` nonbond style indicates the hard-sphere potential; this is the default if no nonbond style is specified. The hard-sphere diameters (not radii)
are given by 

.. code-block:: none

	nonbond_coeff index sigma

where ``index`` is the atom type index assigned by the SPHERE statements.

If no ``nonbond_coeff`` is specified at all, then the potential defaults to ``HS`` using the radii ``r`` specified in the SPHERE statements.  This is
the case even if ``nonbond_style`` is specified as ``LJ`` or ``WCA``.
