The primary input file, also known as a ``.bod`` file and required by all types of calculation, contains the description
of the object and some additional input parameters. Additionally, an optional ``.ff`` file may be specified for virial calculations, containing information about the inter- and intra-particle force fields; if not specified, objects are considered to be rigid assemblies of particles interacting as hard spheres.

Defining the object(s)
----------------------

A single object of interest must be described by a collection of spheres
and cuboids, which may or may not be overlapping. The code has also be extended for the case of running not just a single snapshot composed of a collection of spheres, but also a trajectory or series of snapshots each composed of a collection of spheres. In all cases the shape of the object is defined in the ``.bod`` file.

Spheres
~~~~~~~

Spheres are defined by lines of the form

.. code-block:: none

	SPHERE x y z r

where ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` are the coordinates of the center of the 
sphere and ``r`` is the radius.

For example, a ``.bod`` file that contains the
following describes an object composed of two spheres: one of radius 2
at :math:`x=0`, :math:`y=0`, and :math:`z=1` and one of radius 3 at
:math:`x=0`, :math:`y=0`, and :math:`z=-1`.
	
.. code-block:: none

	SPHERE 0 0 1 2
	SPHERE 0 0 -1 3   

Virial-coefficient calculations can use only SPHERE, not CUBOID, etc..

Cuboids
~~~~~~~

Cuboids can be defined in several ways.  The most basic is a line of the
form

.. code-block:: none

	CUBOID x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2

where ``x1``, ``y1``, and ``z1`` are the coordinates of one corner of the
cuboid and ``x2``, ``y2``, and ``z2`` are the coordinates of the opposite
corner.  The edges of the cuboid are aligned with the :math:`x, y, z` axes.

A cuboid with all edges the same length is a cube.  Cubes can be defined
with lines of the form

.. code-block:: none

	CUBE x y z L

where ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` are the coordinates of one corner of the cube
and ``L`` is the edge length.  This is equivalent to

.. code-block:: none

	CUBOID x y z x+L y+L z+L

For example, a ``.bod`` file that contains the following describes an
object composed of two cuboids: one with a corner at :math:`x=0, y=0, z=0`
and opposite corner at :math:`x=1, y=2, z=3` and one with a corner at
:math:`x=1, y=0, z=0` and opposite corner at :math:`x=5, y=4, z=4`.

.. code-block:: none

	CUBOID 0 0 0 1 2 3
	CUBE 1 0 0 4

Finally, sets of cuboids can be defined in a binary file in the ``.fits.gz``
format [1]_ using the voxels command.  Voxels are specified with lines of the
form

.. code-block:: none

	VOXELS <relative path to .fits.gz file>

Paths to the ``.fits.gz`` file are relative to the location of the ``.bod``
file.  So, for example, if you had a voxels file ``voxels.fits.gz`` in the
same directory as the ``.bod`` file, you could simply specify it as

.. code-block:: none

	VOXELS voxels.fits.gz

.. [1] https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/

Multiple snapshots or trajectories of spheres
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to be compatible with a variety of existing software packages, the trajectories of spheres are defined using the xyz file format and referenced in the ``.bod`` file. The format of the xyz file is

.. code-block:: none

	<number of atoms>
	comment line
	<atom type> <x> <y> <z>
	...

where ``atom type`` can be either a number or string, such as an element symbol. This structure can be repeated multiple times for multiple snapshots. For example,

.. code-block:: none

	2
	snapshot 1
	A -1 0 0
	B 0.25 0 0
	1
	snapshot 2
	A 0 0 0

would define two spheres of different types for the first snapshot and one sphere for the second snapshot where that sphere is the same type as the first sphere in the first snapshot. As the xyz file format does not contain radii information, a second conversion file that defines the radius of each atom type is needed. The conversion file format is

.. code-block:: none

	<atom type> <radius>

Each atom type in the xyz file must be defined. A corresponding conversion file for the xyz file example could be

.. code-block:: none

	A 1
	B 0.25

In this case, together the two examples define a system of two touching spheres one of radius 1 and one of radius 1/4 for the first snapshot and a single sphere of radius 1 for the second snapshot.
 
The xyz file and the conversion file are specified in the ``.bod`` file as

.. code-block:: none

	TRAJECTORY <relative path to xyz file> <relative path to conversion file>
	
Note that if a trajectory is given, no other geometry may be included in the ``.bod`` file.

Trajectory files cannot be used for virial-coefficient calculations.

Force-field file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virial-coefficient calculations may use a force-field file. The name of this file is specified in the ``.bod`` as follows

.. code-block:: none

	FORCEFIELD <filename.ff>

The .ff suffix is not required, but is a suggested convention. The format of the content of this file is described below.

|                   | of the sphere from which random   |
|                   | walks are launched. The radius    |

Force fields
----------------------

Virial-coefficient calculations perform sampling of object configurations (arrangement and orientation of objects with respect to each other) and conformations (arrangement of the particles making up a single object). The choice of these arrangements is governed by the inter- and intra-molecular force fields, or energy functions. Further, the inter-particle energies enter into the calculation of the quantities that are averaged in the Mayer-sampling method used to compute the virial coefficients. A ``.ff`` may be specified as described above to define these interactions.  The content of this file is described here. If a ``.ff`` file is not specified, all interactions are taken to be additive hard-sphere with the specified diameters, and all objects are considered to be rigid assemblies.

Inter-particle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Intra-particle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Force fields acting between and among atoms within a single object control its flexibility and the conformations that it can adopt.  The types of interactions include 2-body (bond stretching), and 3-body (bond bending); 4-body (torsion) potentials are not supported.

Two-body potentials are specified as follows:

``bond_style string``

where ``string`` may be

Three-body potentials are specified as follows:

``angle_style string``
