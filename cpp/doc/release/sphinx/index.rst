ZENO
====

The ZENO software tool computes material, solution, and suspension properties for a specifed particle
shape or molecular structure using path-integral and Monte Carlo methods. These properties include:
capacitance, electric polarizability tensor, intrinsic conductivity, volume, gyration tensor, hydrodynamic
radius, intrinsic viscosity, friction coeffcient, diffusion coeffcient, sedimentation coeffcient, and related
quantities.
