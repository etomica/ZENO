# ZENO
A software tool based on Monte Carlo methods, ZENO computes material properties at nanoscale. These properties include: capacitance, electric polarizability tensor, intrinsic conductivity, volume, gyration tensor, hydrodynamic radius, intrinsic viscosity, friction coefficient, diffusion coefficient, sedimentation coefficient, virial coefficients, and related quantities. For further details, the documentation can be found [here](https://zeno.nist.gov).
